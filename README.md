# Malie-Repacker
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ForumHulp/pageaddon.svg?branch=master)](http://vnx.uvnworks.com)\
Simple malie engine resource repack/unpacker made by C#\
It was implanted in C language due to problems such as memory issues and speed, and I will not upload it because my interest disappears\

## Feature
### Easy to use
Just select menu (unpack, repack) and enter the file or directory path.\
Malie-Repacker automatically  detects and unpack file.
### Speed
Camelia cipher implemented in [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) was converted to C#.\
Multi-threads are used when packing/unpacking multiple files.\
Single file unpack speed is similar as [GARbro](https://github.com/morkt/GARbro).\
When multi-threads are using, it's much faster. 
### Repack
It support repackaging.
